# Ruby Exercises (Card #31)
The idea of this ticket is to practice all the things we learned in the previous lessons.

You'll need to create a Github project, and for each exercise make a pr to the main branch.

For testing purpose, you can call a ruby method in your terminal by simple running `ruby -r ./file.rb -e "my_function(var)"` where

- `r` tells ruby to include the filename
- `e` tells ruby to evaluates ruby code
